## Introduction

It does not matter if you find this section first or halfway through, as such there are no prerequisites. Everybody has their own way of learning. 
I will provide you the fundamentals of building your own working cpu. Speed and performance are not yet important in this section. That is what the lessons further down the line are meant for.

## Moore state machines

The ideal way to see a cpu might be based on state machine. A state machine has 2 components: 
1. state - data thats been held in memory/latches and
2. logic - transforming current data into something else with the use of logic (gates). 
That is also pretty much how a cpu can be described.

There is logic to determine what our new state will be, and the actual moment of saving that new state in our registers.

If you wanted to do something like an add operation, say A = B + C, The state of A will be changed with the calculated result of B + C.
