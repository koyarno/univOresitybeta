# CPU

## Introduction

It does not matter if you find this section first or halfway through, as such there are no prerequisites. Everybody has their own way of learning. 
I will provide you the fundamentals of building your own working cpu. Speed and performance are not yet important in this section. That is what the lessons further down the line are meant for.

## finite turing machine

The ideal way to see a cpu might be a finite state machine. A state machine has 2 components: 
1. state - data thats been held in memory/latches and
2. logic - transforming data into something else with the use of logic gates. 

Even though it might be finite state, state can be expanded to great numbers. 
In finite state machines theres the state and the combinational logic to get to that new state. 
Just like math, you want to do a particular calculation, A = B + C where A will be the new state, defined as B added with C.
